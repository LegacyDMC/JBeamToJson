# JBeamToJson


This is a jbeam to json converter written in python.

It works for most of the files that i've tested, but still has few errors, usually related to commas or any weird sort of []{} completion.

the results of this parser are entirely dependant on the way you write your jbeam file. make sure to always write it in a good manner!

For any doubts feel free to contact me in my discord server.
