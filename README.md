For the python r patterns utilized in this code.


This is a jbeam to json converter written in python.

It works for most of the files that i've tested, but still has few errors, usually related to commas or any weird sort of []{} completion.

unlike other parses that i've seen, it preserves the comments, and also in which line the comments where.

the results of this parser are entirely dependant on the way you write your jbeam file. make sure to always write it in a good manner!

For any doubts feel free to contact me in my discord server.

HOW TO USE:

Simply run the .py file on visual studio code, it will ask for the directory where the jbeams are located.

it will then read all jbeams, convert to json and then check if the jsons are valid.

it will also mentioned how many were valids or invalid, and specify which jsons were invalid.
